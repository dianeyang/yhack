Public speaking takes practice. And so, we made Transcribr, a beautiful and functional tool to get real-time feedback about your speech.

Thanks to HTML5 audio capabilities, d3.js, and AlchemyAPI, Transcribr displays useful stats including word count, speed, keywords, and sentiment analysis.

Upon initially visiting, you'll see:
